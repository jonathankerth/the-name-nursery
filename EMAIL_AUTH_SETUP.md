## 🚀 **How It Works:**

### For New Users:

1. Click hamburger menu (≡) → "Sign In / Sign Up"
2. Choose between:
   - **"Continue with Google"** (instant OAuth)
   - **Email form** with "Create Account" mode
3. For email signup: Enter email, password, confirm password
4. Account created → Auto signed in → Menu shows profile

### For Existing Users:

1. Click hamburger menu (≡) → "Sign In / Sign Up"
2. Choose between:
   - **"Continue with Google"** (if they used Google before)
   - **Email form** with "Sign In" mode
3. Enter credentials → Signed in → Access profile features

### Error Handling:

- **Email exists**: "This email is already registered. Try signing in instead."
- **Wrong password**: "Incorrect password. Please try again."
- **Weak password**: "Password is too weak. Please choose a stronger password."
- **Invalid email**: "Please enter a valid email address."
- **User not found**: "No account found with this email. Try signing up instead."

## 🔧 **Firebase Setup Required:**

### Enable Email/Password Authentication:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Click "Email/Password" → Enable → Save
3. **Optional**: Enable "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" for magic links

### Security Rules Already Set:

- Users can only access their own liked names
- Authentication required for all database operations
- Secure by default

## 🎯 **User Experience:**

### Seamless Flow:

1. **Guest** → Browse names, see hearts but can't like
2. **Click heart** → Auth modal appears
3. **Sign up/in** → Modal closes, heart fills, name saved
4. **Return visits** → Auto signed in, full access

### Data Persistence:

- **Google users**: Name and photo from Google account
- **Email users**: Email displayed, generic avatar
- **All users**: Liked names saved to Firestore
- **Cross-device**: Same account, same liked names

## 📱 **Mobile Optimized:**
